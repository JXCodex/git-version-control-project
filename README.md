## App installation instructions

* The project uses readline-sync (see package.json/package-lock.json). 

* Run npm install to get the package.

## Game instructions 

* Using node index.js starts the program. 

* Each player tries to get three marks in a row: vertically, horisontally or diagonally. 

* The players have turns to choose a position from a board with 3x3 spaces. 

* The positions chosen by the first player are marked with X and the positions chosen by the second player with 0. 

* If a player get three marks in a row, he/she wins. 

* If the board gets full without either of the player getting a row of three marks, the game is a draw.
